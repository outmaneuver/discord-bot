we are building a discord bot for my solana nft project
we have 5 collections
the main function of the bot is holder verification
when users visit the verify url, sign into discord and connect their wallet the bot will verify nft ownership by comparing to uploaded json Hashlists
the bux balance in their wallet will be fetched using rpc calls
the bot will assign discord server roles according to nft and token holdings

we will then add server commands so users can access collection and tioken info aswell as their nft holdings and bux balance

sales and listings bot in designated channels

always provide single command to git commit and push to main and heroku after each change
